# NSDTraumaMODS
Code and data for the project on trauma and MultiOrgan Dysfunction development 

The structure is as follows: 

Have to load the two R functions and source them in the code in both of the jupyter notebooks. A folder FigAuc in the directory designed will be created where extra figures are created and stored. 
The data is the .csv here included and is read in the code too so have to include the directory it is found in.
